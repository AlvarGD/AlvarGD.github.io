    <p>I call them Complex numbers because "Imaginary numbers" is complete BS.
    First, let us understand the complex plane.
    It is a simple cartesian plane. Nothing fancy going on for now.

        A complex number is composed of an "imaginary" and a "real" part.
        Of course, remember that there is nothing making the imaginary part less real than the real part.
        In this plane, think of any complex number, lets call it z (like everyone else) sitting on this plane.
        Its position can be described like a+ib. "a" describes its position along the horizontal axis and
        b describes its position along the vertical axis. We say ib because it is multiplied by i
        "i" is the imaginary number. It is positioned 1 unit above the center.
